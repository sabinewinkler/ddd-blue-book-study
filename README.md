# Reading the 'Blue Book' - Domain-Driven Design (Eric Evans) / Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software

Let's study the "(Big) Blue Book" together!

## About the book
"This book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful Software developer" - Kent Beck

Eric Evans' Domain Driven Design[^1] is a classic for a reason. It is a book filled with insights and knowledge that has significantly influenced the thinking about modelling software. Yet, it's been a while since it was written - this year marks the 20th anniversary (!) - , some techniques have been refined since.
That is why we think it is the perfect choice for a study group, where we can deepen our understanding and share our experiences. Whether you're new to DDD or have been practicing it for years, there is (still) wisdom to be found in the blue book.

## Join us on this endeavor
The first session will be about getting to know each other and sharing hopes and expectations for the study group. We recommend reading the foreword and preface before the meeting. Our plan is to read the entire book (again) along a defined schedule that proposes chapters for a bi-weekly meetings to discuss takeaways, questions and ideas.

We're looking forward to meeting you!
